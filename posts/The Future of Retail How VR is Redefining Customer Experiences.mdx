**2. VR: Immersive  Virtual Experiences**

VR by creating fully immersive  virtual environments, offers consumers the opportunity to engage with products and brands in  an entirely  new way. Virtual test drives, virtual fashion shows and tours of virtual showrooms are just a few examples of how  VR is revolutionizing the retail experience.

**3. Spatial Computing: Blending the Physical and Digital**

Spatial computing, the  harmonious fusion of the physical and digital realms, enables  in-store navigation, personalized offers, and optimized store layouts. By seamlessly integrating digital information into the physical retail environment spatial computing enhances  the shopping experience,  making it more efficient and engaging.
