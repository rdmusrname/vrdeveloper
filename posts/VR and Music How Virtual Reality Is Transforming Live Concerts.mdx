## Beyond MelodyVR: Expanding the  VR Music Horizon

Oculus Venues and NextVR  are additional trailblazers in the realm  of VR music experiences, providing immersive performances and concerts that transport viewers into the heart of the musical action. With the global VR market  poised to reach $24.5 billion by  2024, the convergence of AR and VR technologies promises even more captivating and interactive experiences.

VR is poised to  break down  barriers and  expand music's global reach, offering front-row  seats to  performances that may have otherwise been inaccessible due to distance or venue capacity constraints.

MelodyVR's plans to introduce an affordable smartphone-based VR headset priced around $20 further democratize access to VR concerts making them more accessible to a broader audience. This move signals a shift towards making VR concerts a complementary experience rather than  a replacement for traditional  live performances.
